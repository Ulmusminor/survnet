Comparing Classical and Neural Approaches to Time-to-event Prediction in Health Data: A Case Study in R

## What is this project about?

This project aims to compare the performance and interpretability of classic survival analysis vs a simple neural network diagnosis using clinical data. Specifically, it tries to show whether innovative machine learning techniques can improve our ability to model and predict time-to-event outcomes in healthcare contexts.

## Why should I care?

In clinical research, especially in oncology and chronic disease studies, predicting patient outcomes accurately is critical for treatment planning, resource allocation, and trial design. Traditional survival models like the **Cox model** are the current go-to, but they may oversimplify non-linear relationships in complex data.

This project explores whether **neural networks** — widely used in other domains — can provide real performance benefits in survival analysis **without sacrificing interpretability**. It speaks directly to ongoing debates about AI in medicine, especially where stakes are high and explainability matters.

## How do I run it or explore it?

For now, the project is empty, but I plan to write a Quarto that documents all my progress.

Thanks to Quarto, users will be able to see the results and review the code by themselves.

## What tools or data does it use?

I am planning to use public breast cancer databases, which allow me to compare the results. In case the data needed some wrangling, I'll take care of that as well. As for the statistical software tool I will use, it will be R and its packages, which will be mentioned on the go. Two very important libraries I will be using are tidyverse and survival.

## Who made it and under what terms?

I, Marco del Olmo Linares am the sole developer of this project. Please credit me if you intend to reuse or build upon this work. The initial concept was inspired through ChatGPT, but all analysis, writing, and coding are done independently.
